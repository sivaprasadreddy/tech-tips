# Mastering REST API Testing with RestAssured in Java

RestAssured is a powerful and popular tool for testing REST APIs in Java. It streamlines the testing process by offering a domain-specific language (DSL) that simplifies making requests and verifying responses. In this article, we will delve into using RestAssured with practical examples to help you get started.

## Getting Started with RestAssured

RestAssured is an open-source Java library widely used for testing RESTful web services. It provides a straightforward approach to writing API tests and supports both JSON and XML formats.

To begin using RestAssured, include the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file if you are utilizing Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <version>4.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

## Basic Example

Let's explore a basic example of making a GET request using RestAssured:

```java
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

public class BasicTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        given().
            when().get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1").
            then().statusCode(200).
            body("userId", equalTo(1)).
            body("id", equalTo(1));
    }
}
```

In this example, we perform a GET request to a placeholder API and verify the status code along with certain fields in the response body.

## POST Request Example

Here's how to execute a POST request using RestAssured:

```java
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import org.json.JSONObject;

public class PostRequestTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JSONObject requestParams = new JSONObject();
        requestParams.put("title", "foo");
        requestParams.put("body", "bar");
        requestParams.put("userId", 1);

        given().
            header("Content-Type", "application/json").
            body(requestParams.toString()).
            when().post("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts").
            then().statusCode(201);
    }
}
```

This example illustrates sending a JSON payload in a POST request and validating the response status code.

## Handling Authentication

RestAssured supports various authentication mechanisms. Hereâ€™s an example using basic authentication:

```java
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;

public class AuthTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        given().
            auth().basic("username", "password").
            when().get("https://example.com/secure/api").
            then().statusCode(200);
    }
}
```

This example demonstrates how to perform basic authentication while making a GET request.

## Conclusion

RestAssured offers a simple yet powerful way to test REST APIs in Java. With its intuitive DSL, you can quickly write and execute tests for various HTTP requests and validate responses.
